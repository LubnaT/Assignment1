    <h2> Here is the Quote from A<Sup>plus</sup>Topper</h2>
	<h3> <blockquote cite="https://parade.com/1034896/marynliles/nature-quotes/"> <center> <q>Study nature, love nature, stay close to nature. It will never fail you.</q><small> —Frank Lloyd Wright</small></center></blockquote></h3>
	<p class="p"> Every <del> member </del> <ins> human </ins> of the living world obtains its life support from nature. Nature guides the cycling of air, water and life between the different constituents or spheres on Earth. The treasures in nature not only provide for our basic requirements of survival but also fuel the raw materials to support factories and industries on which the modern world primarily runs.<br>Since the population is increasing at an exponential rate largely in India and many parts of the world, the “use” of resources has now turned to depletion. Adding to this, are the excessive levels of atmospheric and environmental pollution. Industrial wastes, unchecked use of vehicles, illegal cutting of trees, poaching of animals, nuclear power plants and many more are contributing to the disruption of the natural systems and global warming.</p>
